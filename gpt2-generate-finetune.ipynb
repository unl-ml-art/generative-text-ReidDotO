    "## Notes\n",
    "If you're creating an API based on your model and need to pass the generated text elsewhere, you can do `text = gpt2.generate(sess, return_as_list=True)[0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass in a `prefix` to the generate function to force the text to start with a given character sequence and generate text from there (good if you add an indicator when the text starts).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also generate multiple texts at a time by specifing `nsamples`. Unique to GPT-2, you can pass a `batch_size` to generate multiple samples in parallel, giving a massive speedup (in Colaboratory, set a maximum of 20 for `batch_size`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n",
    "* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n",
    "* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n",
    "* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n",
    "* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",
    "*  **`include_prefix`**: If using `truncate` and `include_prefix=False`, the specified `prefix` will not be included in the returned text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing multiple prefixes and no prefix multiple times, it seemed like a good idea to restrict the outputs a bit to something that is feasible to create. Multiple different games were ran, but \"Pokemon, but\" seemed to produce very interesting results and fit the YouTube channel's typical videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Temperature of 0.9 seemed to produce the most variation with interesting results without being incoherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length, nsamples, and batch_size were chosen to produce at least 1 full title multiple times with the desired prefix."
